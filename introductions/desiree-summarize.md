## Summary
### FHTH “What is Historiography?”, 1-24.
Desiree' Martinez

- Historiography is the critical assessment of the ways historians try to assess the past events based on the literary statements made about the past. Thus, in analyzing these methods historians can reconstructed the past based on these understanding including specific topics regarding the past. Furthermore, to get a reliable understanding about the past, multiple interpretations are examined with reasoning that a core truth can be determined and therefore studied. (pg. 3-4)
- Due to the fact that Historiography is a "narrative about narratives" several references need to be analyzed; the facts of the past themselves, the ways in which those facts can be discerned and written about, and the mental process of historians. (pg. 5)
- When studying historiography students need to let go of traditional textbook narratives that proclaim authorative truth with big names and stories but understand that history is about interpretations of works of history. These interpretations require questioning which lead students to becoming informed critics. (pg. 6)
- Controversies can arise when questioning details about the past which can be solved through evidence but controversies involving interpretation and meaning may not be easily solved. Therefore, inter and intra personal relationships need to be understood and importance needs to be placed on ideological conviction and human action. (pg. 7)
- History ignites dialogue with and within other academic disiplines like philosophy, anthropology, economics, political science, and literary scholarship. Therefore, it is a historiographers job to define the broader understanding of human affairs and the community of people who have reconstructed the past. (pg. 8)
- History can be viewed, accessed and researched in various ways but historiography should be viewed with a critical lense that acknowledges that our time period is not unique to history and that all perspectives needs to be included beyond the mainstream narrative e.g. history of women, various ethnic groups, homosexuality (pg. 10)
- History can be referred to as a collective equivalent to individual past memory but the value of the collective past can not accurately determine knowledge of the future but give an understanding of consequence. (pg. 15-16)
- Varities of history: political, military, social and microhistory, economic, cultural, and intellectual. (pg. 19-24)
