Discussion Questions


I.	When the author discussed, “the value of history in producing a collective sense of identity” (pp.17), is it a good or bad thing that everything needs to have a collective label to group things?


II.	Out of the four fields of history this reading put forth, which do you find to be the most telling or would be able to make more apparent to what the past was like at different times?



III.	After the introduction to the course last Wednesday and the readings completed for today’s class, has your opinion or interest changed regarding Historiography, if so, what changed it?


IV.	How would you define history?


V.	How does the quote:


        “forgetting…is an essential factor in the creation of a nation and it is for this reason that the progress of historical studies often poses a threat to nationality,” by reviving the memory of episodes of violence and injustice that, he said, were inevitable in the establishment of any country” (pp.15)


    Influence how and in what way we view history? And who decides what aspects are to be forgotten and the ones that will be remembered?
